# Matplotlib library in Python

 Matplotlib library is an amazing visualization and graphical plotting library in Python for 2D plots of array and numerical extension is NumPy. It is open source alternative to MATLAB and we can use it freely. Matplotlib mostly written in python, few segments are written in C.

A python matplotlib script is structured so that few lines of code are all that is required in most insatnce to generate a visual data plot. Matplotlib and its dependencies can be downloaded as a binary package from the Python Package Index(PyPI). By using matplotlib, We can visualize the Machine Learning's Data in differnt plots.

NumPy is a required dependency for matplotlib, which uses for numerical data anad multi-dimensional arrays . Pandas Libray is used by Matplolib mainly for data manipulation anad analysis. Pandas provides an in-memory 2D data table object called a DataFrame .

### Installing the Matpoltlib Library in Python :-

**python -m pip install matplotlib**

Create different types of plot using Matplotlib :-

1) Simple Line Plot.

2) Bar Plot.

3) Pie Plot.

4) Histogram.

5) Scatter Plot.

6) Plot using NumPy array.

7) Plot a Pandas DataFrame
