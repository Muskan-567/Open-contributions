It is open source  alternative to MATLAB and we can use it freely. Matplotlib mostly written in python, few segments are written in C.  \n","\n","A python matplotlib script is structured so that few lines of code are all that is required in most insatnce to generate a visual data plot. Matplotlib and its dependencies can be downloaded as a binary package from the Python Package Index(PyPI). By using matplotlib, We can visualize the Machine Learning's Data in differnt plots.\n","\n","NumPy is a required dependency for matplotlib, which uses for numerical data anad multi-dimensional arrays .
